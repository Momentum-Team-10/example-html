    <h1>Panda Bear</h1>
    <img src="assets/panda-bear.jpg" />
    <p>The giant panda is a rare, endangered and elusive bear. Science used to believe that the giant panda was a member
      of the raccoon family. With DNA analyses science proved itself wrong. The giant panda and the red panda are not
      related. Giant pandas are famous for their love of bamboo, a diet so nutritionally poor that the pandas have to
      consume up to 20kg each day.</p>
